    "## 3. Visualization ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "### Starting from the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook we computed and logged the following features that we can use when creating visualizations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `char_count` : the length of each message in characters\n",
    "- `question_count`: the number of questions in a message\n",
    "- `sentiment_score`: positivity or negativity score of a message (between -1 and 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "For whatsapp conversation, we can also implement:\n",
    "- `time_diff_seconds` (whatsapp only): the time difference in seconds from the previous message\n",
    "- `media_sent` (whatsapp only): the presence of media (audio, file, document, photo, sticker, video) in a message\n",
    "- `emoji_count` (whatsapp only): the number of emojis in a message\n",
    "\n",
    "### Leading with questions\n",
    "\n",
    "In data visualization, it's best to lead with curiosity and make visualizations that help answer questions. With these columns and the types of conversations we have (the play or a conversation with a friend), some questions might be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How long do we take to respond to each other? (Whatsapp data)\n",
    "- Who talks the most? Who sends the most messages?\n",
    "- Who sends the longest messages? What are those messages about? \n",
    "- Is someone more negative or positive than the other? Is there any time that pattern flips?\n",
    "- What's the most common word we use? When and how often do we each use it?\n",
    "\n",
    "These are all questions that can be answered in code and spreadsheets, but we can also answer them using simple graphics like _bar charts_, _line charts_, _histograms_, and _scatterplots_.\n",
