    "Let us first think about what kind of data we want to use. And let us first consider the general case, i.e. some ``Score`` consisting of all kind of musical objects such as ``Note``s, ``Chord``s, bars, measurements and so on. A ``Score`` is a ``Stream``, that is, linear sequence of objects, which we call (musical) **events**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw, *pitch* and *duration* can be represented by floating point numbers. *Pitch* can be either the MIDI note (which can also be rational) or frequency. Since the single input of a neural network can be a floating point number, we could decide to use two inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/float_input_ann.png\" alt=\"\" height=\"250\">\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we have to consider that if we think in terms of dissonant and consonant then MIDI notes close in value are not close with respect to consonance. Relations of notes might have a certain usage in a piece that is completely unrelated to their specific numerical value in MIDI note or frequency. In case of a simple melody, this is probably not that relevant. However, what if we want to use events such as a bar or a change in measurement? Or what if we want to work with ``noteOn``, ``noteOff`` events? Or what about ``Rest``s which have no pitch? How are they related to ``Note``s? These events might be categorical and not numerical.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *one-hot encoding* can be useful if we want to deal with categorical data that can not be ordered. Especially if we deal with sequences, one-hot encoding can work well because it can help the neural network to learn pattern without assuming any inherent ordering in the input. But how does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a vector of numbers representing the temperature of a metal block. The number indicates how hot the block is at a position. One-hot, means that the temperature is concentrated at one specific point. Thus, the vector consists of one ``1`` and all the other values are ``0``.\n",
