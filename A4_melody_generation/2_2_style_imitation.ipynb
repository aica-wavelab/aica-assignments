    "So far we worked directly with the objects of ``music21``. It is however often advisable to work with numbers instead. Our problem is one such situation. Instead of working with notes $\\{n_1, n_2, \\ldots, n_m\\}$ we could work instead with numbers $0,1, \\ldots, m-1$, where each number represents the respective note. We implemented the ``NoteToIntEncoder`` that can be used to do this encoding. It expects a list of ``music21`` ``Stream`` objects to compute the set of notes. The ``encoder`` maps ``Note``s and ``Rest``s to consecutive natural numbers starting from ``0``"
