3001,Pierre_Roland_Renoir,Pierre Roland Renoir,"Pierre Roland Renoir (born July 16, 1958) is a Canadian painter and the great-grandson of Pierre-Auguste Renoir.
Born in Monaco, Pierre Roland Renoir was raised in Cagnes-sur-Mer, the town in France where his great-grandfather painted and sculpted in his final years. He developed an interest in the visual arts at a young age and by the time he was fifteen, had already begun working on metallic plates using the dry-point engraving technique.
In 1978, he emigrated to Canada and made his home in Edmonton, Alberta. In 1981, after rebuilding his portfolio, his first professional art exhibition was organized in Edmonton. Encouraged by the response and appreciation of the public, he began a wider range of exhibitions throughout Canada, the United States and Europe.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Roland_Renoir
3002,Pierre_Roy_(painter),Pierre Roy (painter),"Pierre Roy (10 August 1880 – 26 September 1950) was a French surrealist painter. He is known for his realistically painted compositions of ordinary objects in unexpected arrangements.
He was the eldest of four children of the secretary of the management board of the Musée d'Arts de Nantes who all became amateur painters. After gaining his baccalauréat at the local school he joined a firm of architects before enrolling at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Disappointed with the course, he left to work on the designs for the 1900 Paris Exposition.
In 1905, he decided to devote himself to painting, beginning in 1906 at the Salon of the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts (SNBA), a painters collective. He exhibited in 1907, 1908, 1913 and 1914 at the Société des Artistes Indépendants. In 1925, he took part in the first exhibition by surrealist painters alongside Giorgio de Chirico, Max Ernst and Pablo Picasso, and in 1926 had his first solo exhibition. In 1933 he was appointed for five years as a naval artist.
An exhibition devoted to his work was held at the Galerie des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1935, and his work was displayed at the 1937 World's Fair and the Montaigne Gallery in Paris in 1938. He travelled and exhibited in galleries around the world: in New York at the Brummer Gallery in 1930 and 1933, at the Julien Levy Gallery in 1932, at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1936, at the Carstairs Gallery in 1949, in London in 1934, at the Wildenstein Gallery and in Hawaii in 1939 at the Honolulu Academy of Arts.
In addition he created stage sets, several covers for Vogue magazine, and advertising posters.
His work is classed as surrealism, and is based on assemblages of everyday objects such as shells, vegetables and fruits, woollen reels, ears and seeds, eggs and ribbons arranged to create poetic images.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Roy_(painter)
3003,Pierre_Soulages,Pierre Soulages,"Pierre Jean Louis Germain Soulages (French: [sulaʒ]; 24 December 1919 – 25 October 2022) was a French painter, printmaker, and sculptor. In 2014, President François Hollande of France described him as ""the world's greatest living artist."" His works are held by leading museums of the world, and there is a museum dedicated to his art in his hometown of Rodez.
Soulages is known as ""the painter of black"", owing to his interest in the colour ""both as a colour and a non-colour. When light is reflected on black, it transforms and transmutes it. It opens a mental field all its own."" He saw light as a work material; striations of the black surface of his paintings enable him to reflect light, allowing the black to come out of darkness and into brightness, thus becoming a luminous colour.
Soulages produced 104 stained-glass windows for the Romanesque architecture of the Abbey Church of Sainte-Foy in Conques from 1987 to 1994. He received international awards, and the Louvre in Paris held a retrospective of his works on the occasion of his centenary.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Soulages

As a celebrator of beauty and especially feminine sensuality, it has been said that ""Renoir is the final representative of a tradition which runs directly from Rubens to Watteau.""
He was the father of actor Pierre Renoir (1885–1952), filmmaker Jean Renoir (1894–1979) and ceramic artist Claude Renoir (1901–1969). He was the grandfather of the filmmaker Claude Renoir (1913–1993), son of Pierre.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Auguste_Renoir
3006,Pierre-Joseph_Redouté,Pierre-Joseph Redouté,"Pierre-Joseph Redouté (French pronunciation: [pjɛʁ ʒozɛf ʁədute], 10 July 1759 – 19 June 1840), was a painter and botanist from Belgium, known for his watercolours of roses, lilies and other flowers at the Château de Malmaison, many of which were published as large coloured stipple engravings. He was nicknamed ""the Raphael of flowers"" and has been called the greatest botanical illustrator of all time.
Redouté was an official court artist of Marie Antoinette, and continued painting through the French Revolution and Reign of Terror. He survived the turbulent political upheaval to gain international recognition for his precise renderings of plants, which remain as fresh in the early 21st century as when first painted. He combined great artistic skills with a pleasing and ingratiating personality which assisted him with his influential patrons. After Queen Marie-Antoinette, his patrons included both of Napoleon's wives – Empress Joséphine and Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma – as well as Maria Amalia of Naples and Sicily, wife of Louis Philippe I, the last king of France.
Redouté collaborated with the greatest botanists of his day and participated in nearly fifty publications depicting both the familiar flowers of the French court and plants from places as distant as Japan, America, South Africa, and Australia. He worked from live plants rather than herbarium specimens, which contributed to his fresh subtle renderings. He was painting during a period in botanical illustration (1798 – 1837) that is noted for the publication of outstanding folio editions with coloured plates.  Redouté produced over 2,100 published plates depicting over 1,800 different species, many never rendered before. Of the French botanical illustrators employed in the French capital, Redouté is the one who remains in the public consciousness today. He is seen as an important heir to the tradition of the Flemish and Dutch flower painters Brueghel, Ruysch, van Huysum and de Heem.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Joseph_Redout%C3%A9
3007,Piet_Mondrian,Piet Mondrian,"Pieter Cornelis Mondriaan (Dutch: [ˈpi:tər kɔrˈneːlɪs ˈmɔndrijaːn]), after 1906 known as Piet Mondrian (, also US: , Dutch: [pit ˈmɔndrijɑn]; 7 March 1872 – 1 February 1944), was a Dutch painter and art theoretician who is regarded as one of the greatest artists of the 20th century. He is known for being one of the pioneers of 20th-century abstract art, as he changed his artistic direction from figurative painting to an increasingly abstract style, until he reached a point where his artistic vocabulary was reduced to simple geometric elements.
Mondrian's art was highly utopian and was concerned with a search for universal values and aesthetics. He proclaimed in 1914: ""Art is higher than reality and has no direct relation to reality. To approach the spiritual in art, one will make as little use as possible of reality, because reality is opposed to the spiritual. We find ourselves in the presence of an abstract art. Art should be above reality, otherwise it would have no value for man.""
He was a contributor to the De Stijl art movement and group, which he co-founded with Theo van Doesburg. He evolved a non-representational form which he termed Neoplasticism. This was the new 'pure plastic art' which he believed was necessary in order to create 'universal beauty'. To express this, Mondrian eventually decided to limit his formal vocabulary to the three primary colors (red, blue and yellow), the three primary values (black, white and gray) and the two primary directions (horizontal and vertical). Mondrian's arrival in Paris from the Netherlands in 1911 marked the beginning of a period of profound change. He encountered experiments in Cubism and with the intent of integrating himself within the Parisian avant-garde removed an 'a' from the Dutch spelling of his name (Mondriaan).
Mondrian's work had an enormous influence on 20th century art, influencing not only the course of abstract painting and numerous major styles and art movements (e.g. Color Field painting, Abstract Expressionism and Minimalism), but also fields outside the domain of painting, such as design, architecture and fashion. Design historian Stephen Bayley said: ""Mondrian has come to mean Modernism. His name and his work sum up the High Modernist ideal. I don't like the word 'iconic', so let's say that he's become totemic – a totem for everything Modernism set out to be.""",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian
3008,Pieter_Aertsen,Pieter Aertsen,"Pieter Aertsen (1508, Amsterdam – 2 June 1575, Amsterdam), called Lange Piet (""Tall Pete"") because of his height, was a Dutch painter in the style of Northern Mannerism.  He is credited with the invention of the monumental genre scene, which combines still life and genre painting and often also includes a biblical scene in the background. He was active in his native city Amsterdam but also worked for a long period in Antwerp, then the centre of artistic life in the Netherlands.
His genre scenes were influential on later Flemish Baroque painting, Dutch still life painting and also in Italy. His peasant scenes preceded by a few years the much better-known paintings produced in Antwerp by Pieter Bruegel the Elder.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieter_Aertsen
3009,Pieter_Anthonisz._van_Groenewegen,Pieter Anthonisz. van Groenewegen,"Pieter Anthonisz. van Groenewegen (1590/1600–1658) was a Dutch Golden Age landscape painter.
Groenewegen, who was born in Delft, primarily painted landscapes. He traveled to Italy and between ca. 1615-1623 he lived on Via Bocca de Leone in Rome, where he became a member of the Bentvueghels with the nickname ""Leeuw""(Lion). He returned to Delft where he became a member of the Guild of Saint Luke in 1626, but spent the last few years of his life in The Hague, where he joined the Confrerie Pictura in 1657. He died there in the following year.
Many of his works now reside at the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieter_Anthonisz._van_Groenewegen
3010,Pieter_Bruegel_the_Elder,Pieter Bruegel the Elder,"Pieter Bruegel (also Brueghel or Breughel) the Elder ( BROY-gəl, also US:  BROO-gəl; Dutch: [ˈpitər ˈbrøːɣəl] ; c. 1525–1530 – 9 September 1569) was among the most significant artists of Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting, a painter and printmaker, known for his landscapes and peasant scenes (so-called genre painting); he was a pioneer in presenting both types of subject as large paintings.
He was a formative influence on Dutch Golden Age painting and later painting in general in his innovative choices of subject matter, as one of the first generation of artists to grow up when religious subjects had ceased to be the natural subject matter of painting. He also painted no portraits, the other mainstay of Netherlandish art. After his training and travels to Italy, he returned in 1555 to settle in Antwerp, where he worked mainly as a prolific designer of prints for the leading publisher of the day. At the end of the 1550s, he switched to make painting his main medium, and all his famous paintings come from the following period of little more than a decade before his early death in 1569, when he was probably in his early forties.
In the 20th and 21st centuries, Bruegel's works have inspired artists in both the literary arts and in cinema. His painting Landscape with the Fall of Icarus, now thought only to survive in copies, is the subject of the final lines of the 1938 poem ""Musée des Beaux Arts"" by W. H. Auden. Russian film director Andrei Tarkovsky refers to Bruegel's paintings in his films several times, notably in Solaris (1972) and The Mirror (1975). Director Lars von Trier also uses Bruegel's paintings in his film Melancholia (2011).

The large output of his studio (some 1,400 pictures exist with plausible links to Brueghel and his shop), which produced for the local and export market, contributed to the international spread of his father's imagery.
Traditionally Pieter Brueghel the Younger has been nicknamed ""de helse Brueghel"" or ""Hellish Brueghel"" because it was believed he was the author of several paintings with fantastic depictions of fire and grotesque imagery.

3042,Pompeo_Batoni,Pompeo Batoni,"Pompeo Girolamo Batoni (25 January 1708 – 4 February 1787) was an Italian painter who displayed a solid technical knowledge in his portrait work and in his numerous allegorical and mythological pictures. The high number of foreign visitors travelling throughout Italy and reaching Rome during their ""Grand Tour"" led the artist to specialize in portraits.
Batoni won international fame largely thanks to his customers, mostly British of noble origin, whom he portrayed, often with famous Italian landscapes in the background. Such Grand Tour portraits by Batoni were in British private collections, thus ensuring the genre's popularity in Great Britain. One generation later, Sir Joshua Reynolds would take up this tradition and become the leading English portrait painter. Although Batoni was considered the best Italian painter of his time, contemporary chronicles mention his rivalry with Anton Raphael Mengs.
In addition to art-loving nobility, Batoni's subjects included the kings and queens of Poland, Portugal, and Prussia; the Holy Roman Emperors Joseph II and Leopold II (a fact which earned him noble dignity); the popes Benedict XIV, Clement XIII, and Pius VI, Elector Karl Theodor of Bavaria; and many more. He also received numerous commissions for altarpieces for churches (in Rome, Brescia, Lucca and Parma, for example) as well as for mythological and allegorical subjects.
Batoni's style took inspiration and incorporated elements of classical antiquity, French Rococo, Bolognese classicism, and the work of artists such as Nicolas Poussin, Claude Lorrain, and especially Raphael.

3067,Raffaello_Santi,Raphael,"Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino (Italian: [raffaˈɛllo ˈsantsjo da urˈbiːno]; March 28 or April 6, 1483 – April 6, 1520), now generally known in English as Raphael (UK:  RAF-ay-əl, US:  RAF-ee-əl, RAY-fee-, RAH-fy-EL), was an Italian painter and architect of the High Renaissance. His work is admired for its clarity of form, ease of composition, and visual achievement of the Neoplatonic ideal of human grandeur. Together with Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, he forms the traditional trinity of great masters of that period.
His father was court painter to the ruler of the small but highly cultured city of Urbino. He died when Raphael was eleven, and Raphael seems to have played a role in managing the family workshop from this point. He trained in the workshop of Perugino, and was described as a fully trained ""master"" by 1500.  He worked in or for several cities in north Italy until in 1508 he moved to Rome at the invitation of Pope Julius II, to work on the Apostolic Palace at the Vatican.  He was given a series of important commissions there and elsewhere in the city, and began to work as an architect. He was still at the height of his powers at his death in 1520.
Raphael was enormously productive, running an unusually large workshop and, despite his early death at 37, leaving a large body of work. His career falls naturally into three phases and three styles, first described by Giorgio Vasari: his early years in Umbria, then a period of about four years (1504–1508) absorbing the artistic traditions of Florence, followed by his last hectic and triumphant twelve years in Rome, working for two popes and their close associates. Many of his works are found in the Vatican Palace, where the frescoed Raphael Rooms were the central, and the largest, work of his career. The best known work is The School of Athens in the Vatican Stanza della Segnatura. After his early years in Rome, much of his work was executed by his workshop from his drawings, with considerable loss of quality. He was extremely influential in his lifetime, though outside Rome his work was mostly known from his collaborative printmaking.

After his death, the influence of his great rival Michelangelo was more widespread until the 18th and 19th centuries, when Raphael's more serene and harmonious qualities were again regarded as the highest models. Thanks to the influence of art historian Johann Joachim Winckelmann, his work became a formative influence on Neoclassical painting, but his techniques would later be explicitly and emphatically rejected by groups such as the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael

Rajesh Soni's talents for sketching and drawing were noticed at an early age and fostered by his father.  As a young boy, Rajesh sketched from life the historic havelis  and architecture of Udaipur's old city, sometimes looking over the shoulders of art students who gathered to sketch on the ghats, and also eagerly teaching himself English from visiting tourists. In 2007 Rajesh met the American photographer Waswo X. Waswo, who encouraged him to work on reviving the tradition of hand-colored photography. Working on Waswo's digital prints, Soni blended his grandfather's traditional craft with the new technologies of photographic printing. This collaborative effort between Soni and Waswo, combined with a series of collaborative miniatures Waswo had done in conjunction with the painter Rakesh Vijay, was eventually to become an exhibition that toured India under the name A Studio in Rajasthan.

After the war, he split his years between California and the Pacific, depicting landscapes and exoticized Pacific Islander people in oil on board and black velvet.
Career Tyree was born in Irvine, Kentucky and moved to Delhi, California as an infant.  He was awarded a scholarship to the California College of the Arts (Oakland) for a portrait he painted of his future wife, Marguerite (Margo) Almeida and also studied at the San Francisco School of Fine Arts. Seven weeks after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor he joined the Marines. He trained at the base in San Diego before being shipped off to Samoa in the summer of 1942. Private Tyree was befriended by his Commanding General, Charles F.B. Price and became the Marine-base artist in Samoa. His portrait art career began by painting the officers and their loved ones, while corresponding with art infused  love letters to his girlfriend Margo back home in Turlock, California. He returned to San Diego in April, 1944 and was stationed at Camp Pendleton, Oceanside, CA . On June 27, 1945, Tyree married Margo. He was discharged from the service on January 24, 1946.Soon after Tyree started his family, and began his professional art career in central California.

Often, from there, he would travel to other pacific islands: Palau, Fiji, Tahiti, Samoa, and the Solomon Islands over his thirty-year career. He is best known for his nude and semi-nude paintings of women of the Pacific islands. Most of his first works were sensualized Pacific Islander women in tropical beach and forest settings. He painted primarily with oils on board but also occasionally on canvas and with pastels. To add depth and texture, he switched in mid-career (1960) to painting with oils on fine, French silk, black velvet. This was in the midst of the 1960s' Tiki revolution and many of his nude pieces would be displayed in Tiki bars and restaurants. In the 1970s, he started painting endangered animals to call attention to their limited numbers.  Burke Tyree died at age 57 of a heart attack at his home in Crows Landing, California.

3077,Ramón_Piaguaje,Ramón Piaguaje,"Ramón Piaguaje (born 1962 in the Cuyabeno Reserve in the Amazon rainforest, Ecuador), is the son of Cecilio Piaguaje, the Chief of the Secoya Indians. He lives with his wife and four children deep in the rainforest in Secoya territory, close to the Aguarico River. From an early age, he drew the rainforest with his fingers in the sand and later worked with black ink on paper. The young man who has captured the attention of the art world was first encouraged in his efforts by Orville and Mary Johnson, Wycliffe Bible Translators working in his village.  The discovery of colored pencils at the evangelical missionary school he later attended enabled him to further develop his talent.

In 1993, an American anthropologist, William Vickers, who had been studying the Secoya Indians for many years, spotted him drawing and recognised the quality of his work. He gave him some tubes of oil paints and encouraged him to paint in colour, something which Ramón Piaguaje had been unaware it was possible to do. He spent months experimenting with the colours he had, attempting to replicate the extraordinary range of colours to be found in the trees, flowers, and wildlife around him. Within a year he had developed an astonishing eye and memory for colour. William Vickers helped to organise an exhibition of his work at the Catholic University in Quito, Ecuador.
His painting ""Eternal Amazon"" was selected from over 22,000 entries by professionals and amateur artists from 51 countries won the first prize of the United Nations Millennium Art Exhibition in aid of UNICEF - ""Our World in the Year 2000.""
When the elderly missionary couple, Orville and Mary Johnson, heard about the exhibit at the United Nations, they decided to surprise the South American artist. They entered the exhibition hall and found Ramon surrounded by many people. As he looked beyond his admiring fans, he saw the Johnsons and began to cry.
They hugged and wept for several moments. In Secoya, Ramon repeated over and over to Orville and Mary, ""You are the ones that should be honored, not me…for you came to give us the gospel, and I believe that is why I now can be here.""
Since then, he has met the Prince of Wales, who was patron of the event, and the secretary general of the United Nations Kofi Annan, and ""Eternal Amazon"" has been viewed by ambassadors, artists, dignitaries, and members of the press and public from around the world.
When he won he commented: ‘I entered the competition because I wanted to deliver a message to the rest of the world about the importance of keeping this “lung of the world” free from pollution and destruction. I paint what I see and where I live. It is a beautiful, positive, and peaceful way of showing my world. The forest is all we have. I hope that when people see my picture, they do not just look at my art, but realise that it is their obligation to help to preserve the Amazon rainforest. My tribe, the Secoyas, have lived in these forests for thousands of years and to see a tree fall is like seeing a loved one die. We need the world to help us to protect the rainforest’.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram%C3%B3n_Piaguaje

He was a good friend of Pablo Picasso and an early mentor to young Salvador Dalí. Dalí met Pichot in Cadaqués, Spain, when Dalí was only 10 years old. Pichot also made many trips to France, and once in a while, Dalí and his family would go on a trip with Pichot and his family.
He married Germaine Pichot, a well-known artist's model, in 1906. Together they had a restaurant near the Bateau Lavoir, called La maison rose. Pichot left Paris after World War I but returned often to buy books, as he had turned into a bibliophile. On such a trip, he suddenly died on 1 March 1925. Picasso was so shaken by this that he included Pichot's figure in the painting ""Three Dancers"", on which he was working at the time.
In The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas, Gertrude Stein describes Pichot as follows:

...Spanish painter Pichot, [...] was rather a wonderful creature, he was long and thin like one of those primitive Christs in Spanish churches and when he did a Spanish dance which he did later at the famous banquet to Rousseau, he was awe-inspiringly religious.

Rembrandt never went abroad but was considerably influenced by the work of the Italian Old Masters and Dutch and Flemish artists who had studied in Italy.  After he achieved youthful success as a portrait painter, Rembrandt's later years were marked by personal tragedy and financial hardships.
